# Processing Keras OSC
> Get processing (or any other OSC receiving platform) talking to a Keras VGG16 script for basic, general object recognition

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
cd processingVGG16
python install -r requirements.txt
python receive_osc_vgg.py
```

## Motivation
Run object recognition with python and send it output via OSC to Processing (or any other software). The process:
    1) Take a screenshot of an image
    2) process it with OpenCV and Keras
    3) send results via OSC to another program

This is useful in art/performance settings to incorporate general object recognition. This could also work with ResNet, MobileNet, or a custom model.
